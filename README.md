# Frrand—RESTful API

Made with Python (Eve) and MongoDB deployed on Tornado on EC2 instances. We used this for Frrand in production.

Frrand was a free crowd-sourced delivery network that tried to disrupt the last-mile industry. The idea was to get people already going in a particular direction or route to make deliveries on the way—earning a credit without really inconveniencing them. Users can also make delivery requests by paying with a credit.

We ended up with 2,000+ users and 600+ Facebook likes, but failed to take it to the next step without a business machine on our team. Interested? Chat with me: ken@kenma.ca

The front-end can be found on a separate (private) repo.
